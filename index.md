## About Me

<img align="left" width="350" height="350" src="https://johnaceto.github.io/assets/img/testme.jpg">

I am a student at Rutgers University studying computer science. I am scheduled to graduate from Rutgers in December of 2020.

I have a passion for programming and hope to find a job where my programming skills can be put to good use. I am proficient in Java, C, and Python and am learning other languages such as Swift.

The most experience I have had programming was working at ID Tech where I would teach young programmers game development in java, machine learning in Python, basics of javascript, and modding minecraft with Java. I currently work for the school of communication and information at Rutgers as an IT Helpdesk Assistant.
