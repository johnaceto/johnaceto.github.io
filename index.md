## About Me

<img align="left" width="350" height="350" hspace="20" src="https://johnaceto.github.io/assets/img/testme.jpg">

I am a student at Rutgers University studying computer science. I am scheduled to graduate from Rutgers in December of 2020.

I have a passion for programming and hope to find a job where my programming skills can be put to good use. I am proficient in Java, C, and Python and am learning other languages such as Swift.

The most experience I have had programming was working at ID Tech where I would teach young programmers game development in java, machine learning in Python, basics of javascript, and modding minecraft with Java. I currently work for the school of communication and information at Rutgers as an IT Helpdesk Assistant.

If you would like to know more about me, you can check out my github, linked-in, and resume links at the top of the page.
